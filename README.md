# Zap :zap:


[Zap](https://zap.jackmallers.com) is a free Lightning Network wallet focused on user experience and ease of use, with the overall goal of helping the cryptocurrency community scale Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Zap is built on top of [LND](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd),
uses a [Node.js](https://github.com/LN-Zap/zap-nodejs) proxy and,
[Electron](https://electron.atom.io/) + [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) + [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/tree/master/docs) for the UI. Join us on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/zaphq/shared_invite/enQtMjQ2NTg3NzA5NTkwLTRjNjNhMDc5ZmIyNTA4ZTJiNDNiYzlkM2E5NzhlOTU5ZTI5ZGIxYzQ4NWI5NTcyYjQxZDEzNTQwNmJkNzQ1NmE) to discuss development, design and product.

## Requirements

* An up and running BTCD
* An up and running :zap: LND - see [install.md](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md)
* Node.js version >= 7 and npm version >= 4

## Install

**If you have installation or compilation issues, please file a GitHub issue.**

After installing the above requirements, clone the repo via git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LN-Zap/zap-desktop.git
```

After the repo is cloned, you'll want to generate a Node.js compatible cert:

```bash
# For Linux
$ cd ~/.lnd
# For Mac
$ cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Lnd
# For Windows
$ cd \Users\{your_user_name}\AppData\Local\Lnd

# Then generate the cert
$ openssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -out tls.key
$ openssl req -new -sha256 -key tls.key -out csr.csr -subj '/CN=localhost/O=lnd'
$ openssl req -x509 -sha256 -days 3650 -key tls.key -in csr.csr -out tls.cert
$ rm csr.csr
```

Once you've created the Node.js compatible cert, paste the path to your cert in `app/lnd/config/index.js`:

```js
// Cert will be located depending on your machine
// Mac OS X: /Users/{your_user_name}/Library/Application Support/Lnd/tls.cert
// Linux: ~/.lnd/tls.cert
// Windows: C:\Users\{your_user_name}\AppData\Local\Lnd\tls.cert

export default {
  ...,
  cert: '/path/to/cert/tls.cert'
}
```

And then install dependencies with yarn:

```bash
$ cd zap-desktop
$ yarn

# For Mac & Linux
$ ./node_modules/.bin/electron-rebuild

# For Windows
$ .\node_modules\.bin\electron-rebuild.cmd
```

Then to start it:
```bash
$ npm run dev
```

## Test
```bash
$ npm run test
```

## Lint
```bash
$ npm run lint
```
